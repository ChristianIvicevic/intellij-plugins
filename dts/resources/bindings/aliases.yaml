  A devicetree may have an aliases node that defines one or more alias 
  properties. The alias node shall be at the root of the devicetree.
  
  Each property of the node defines an alias. The property name specifies the
  alias name. The property value specifies the full path to a node in the 
  devicetree. For example, the following property defines the alias serial0. 
  
  serial0 = "/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@llc500"; 
  
  An alias value is a device path and is encoded as a string. The value 
  represents the full path to a node, but the path does not need to refer to 
  a leaf node.
  
  A client program may use an alias property name to refer to a full device 
  path as all or part of its string value. A client program, when considering 
  a string as a device path, shall detect and use the alias.
