  The chosen node does not represent a real device in the system but describes 
  parameters chosen or specified by the system firmware at run time. It shall 
  be a child of the root node. For example:
  
  chosen {
      bootargs = "root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.1.1 ...";
  };

    type: string
    description: |
      A string that specifies the boot arguments for the client program. 
      The value could potentially be a null string if no boot arguments 
      are required.

  stdout-path:
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that specifies the full path to the node representing the 
      device to be used for boot console output. If the character ":" is 
      present in the value it terminates the path. The value may be an 
      alias. If the stdin-path property is not specified, stdout-path 
      should be assumed to define the input device.
