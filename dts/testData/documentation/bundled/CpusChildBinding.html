If other more complex CPU topographies are designed, the binding for the CPU must describe the topography (e.g. threads that don&#39;t share an MMU).<br/><br/>CPUs and threads are numbered through a unified number-space that should match as closely as possible the interrupt controller&#39;s numbering of CPUs/threads.<br/><br/>Properties that have identical values across cpu nodes may be placed in the cpus node instead. A client program must first examine a specific cpu node, but if an expected property is not found then it should look at the parent cpus node. This results in a less verbose representation of properties which are identical across all CPUs.<br/><br/>The node name for every CPU node should be cpu.</div></body></html>
