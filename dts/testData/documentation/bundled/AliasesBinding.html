The alias node shall be at the root of the devicetree.<br/><br/>Each property of the node defines an alias. The property name specifies the alias name. The property value specifies the full path to a node in the devicetree. For example, the following property defines the alias serial0.<br/><br/><code><span style="color:#660e7a;font-weight:bold;">serial0&#32;</span><span style="">=&#32;</span><span style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold;">"/simple-bus@fe000000/serial@llc500"</span><span style="">;</span></code><br/><br/>An alias value is a device path and is encoded as a string. The value represents the full path to a node, but the path does not need to refer to a leaf node.<br/><br/>A client program may use an alias property name to refer to a full device path as all or part of its string value. A client program, when considering a string as a device path, shall detect and use the alias.</div></body></html>
