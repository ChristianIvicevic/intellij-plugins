    Property to identify that a device can be used as wake up source.
    <br/><br/>
    When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the device that tells the system that the device is capable of wake up the system.
    <br/><br/>
    Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.
